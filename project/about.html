            <div id="about">
                <p>Steep Mountain Knife Company was founded in 2001, as a small family run business located beneath the steepest mountains in North America - The Wellsville's. Thus the name, Steep Mountain!   We began as a wholesale business selling mid to high end knives to the gift and tourist industry.</p>
                <p>In 2005 Rock Creek Trading Company was established as we sought to expand our product line, beyond that of knives.  One of the first items we crafted in the Rock Creek Trading line were the Moose Head and Bear Claw Salad Servers.</p>
                <p>Other top sellers in the Rock Creek Trading line include our Walking Sticks, Whale Tail, and Lobster Salad Servers, and our knives.  In recent years we have expanded our inventory to include Wooden Cutting & Serving Boards, Floursack Towels, BBQ Claws, and more! The vast majority of our product line can be customized with a logo or  namedrop of your choice.</p>
                <p>Jodi Lundberg, Rock Creek Trading employee, purchased the business in January 2016. Together Jodi, her husband, Lyle, and their four children run the family business, which is still located  beneath the Wellsville Mountains in Logan, Utah.</p>
